## Theming

Theme package from lundium contains basic theme for components. In
order to use it, we first have to import library into project:

```bash
yarn add @lundium/theme-basic
```

```bash
npm install @lundium/theme-basic
```

Then, we can load minified styled inside of application root:

```javascript
import '@lundium/theme-basic/dist/index.css';
```

If you want to use only a part of predefined styles, you can use sass
source files. They can be imported in a same way as you'd partialy
import bootstrap files: (into you root scss file preferably)

```css
@import 'node_modules/@lundium/theme-basic/scss/front.scss';
```
