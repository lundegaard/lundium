## Localisation

For support of other locales than default english one, you can use
localized messages from `@lundium/locale` lackage. In order to use it,
we first have to import library into project:

```bash
yarn add @lundium/locale
```

```bash
npm install @lundium/locale
```

Then, we can load desired locale object into project and pass it to
ThemeProvider component

```javascript
import { cs_CZ } '@lundium/locale';
// Or by individual import
import cs_CZ from '@lundium/locale/cs_CZ';
...
<ThemeProvider theme={{ isRTL: false, locale: cs_CZ }}>
	...
```

If you want to use only a part of predefined styles, you can use sass
source files. They can be imported in a same way as you'd partialy
import bootstrap files: (into you root scss file preferably)

```css
@import 'node_modules/@lundium/theme-basic/scss/front.scss';
```
